P.S.
I used the Prettier extension in Visual Studio Code to automatically format my HTML and CSS code.
This tool is not prohibited in the assignment instructions, and it helps keep the code consistent, clean, and readable.
However, due to automatic formatting, some closing tags or indentation might look slightly different from manual formatting.
